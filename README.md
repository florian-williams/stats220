# Stats 220 Statistics Project
## Introduction
Hello, my name is Florian Williams, and this is (almost) **my very first time** using GitHub!

I will be using this repo for my Stats 220 coursework.

I am:
1. a statistics major
2. a psychology major
3. a technology enthusiast

That is to say, I am excited about this course, and looking forward to getting into it!

## Off-topic Silliness
Go to the [Comedy Fest](https://www.comedyfestival.co.nz/)!

Also, the *Auckland Arts Festival* has kicked off! You'll find me attending:

* *[Diptych: The missing door & The lost room](https://www.aaf.co.nz/event/diptych)*
* *[Gravity & Grace](https://www.aaf.co.nz/event/gravity-and-grace)*
* *[The Sun and the Wind](https://www.aaf.co.nz/event/sun-and-the-wind)*

and hopefully many more events throughout the month!

### Baking!
I love baking, so I've put a photo of one of my favourite things to bake below (cinnamon buns!). I made *a lot* of cinnamon buns during lockdown, and though these ones look pretty messy, they were some of the most delicious.
