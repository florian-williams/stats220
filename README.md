# Stats 220 Statistics Project
## Introduction
Hello, my name is Florian Williams, and this is (almost) **my very first time** using GitHub!

I will be using this repo for my *Stats 220* coursework.

I am:
1. a statistics major
2. a psychology major
3. a technology enthusiast

That is to say, I am excited about this course, and looking forward to getting into it!
